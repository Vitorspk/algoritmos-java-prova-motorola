# Java Algorithms Examples

This repository contains a collection of simple Java examples that demonstrate various algorithms and data structures.

## Structure

The code is organized into the following packages:

- `com.motorola.examples`: The main package, containing a `Main` class to run all the examples.
- `com.motorola.examples.arraymultidimensionais.bidimencionais`: Examples of multidimensional arrays.
- `com.motorola.examples.byt`: Examples of bitwise operations.
- `com.motorola.examples.queue`: An example of a simple queue.

## How to Run

To run the examples, you first need to compile the Java files. You can do this from the root of the project with the following command:

```bash
javac -d bin src/com/motorola/examples/**/*.java src/com/motorola/examples/*.java
```

Then, you can run the main menu with the following command:

```bash
java -cp bin com.motorola.examples.Main
```

This will present you with a menu where you can choose which example to run.
